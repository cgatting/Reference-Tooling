\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Overview}
The Internet of Things (\textbf{IoT}) epitomises a paradigm shift in technological advancement, fostering an ecosystem where devices seamlessly communicate and autonomously exchange data across intricate networks. This transformative progression has revolutionised human interaction with their immediate and broader environments, addressing multifaceted challenges prevalent in sectors such as healthcare, agriculture, smart home systems, and environmental monitoring. Specifically, environmental monitoring stands to gain substantially from IoT advancements, as it facilitates real-time and continuous data acquisition of critical parameters including temperature, humidity, and air quality.

The significance of indoor air quality and environmental conditions cannot be overstated, given their profound implications on human health and productivity. Suboptimal indoor environments are correlated with respiratory ailments, allergic reactions, and diminished cognitive functions. Furthermore, aberrant temperature and humidity levels contribute to discomfort and inefficient energy utilisation, which is particularly pertinent in residential and office settings.

This project is dedicated to the conception and development of a \textbf{Home Environmental Monitoring System} leveraging the capabilities of the \textbf{Raspberry Pi 4}. Through the integration of high-precision sensors and the implementation of Python-based software solutions, the system is engineered to deliver real-time environmental data via a responsive web interface accessible from any internet-connected device. This approach ensures that users can access critical environmental information effortlessly from anywhere, thereby facilitating informed decision-making for indoor environmental management.

\subsection{Relevance to Environmental Monitoring}
In contemporary society, individuals are predominantly confined to indoor environments, underscoring the imperative need to monitor and maintain optimal indoor air quality, temperature, and humidity levels. Accumulation of indoor air pollutants such as carbon dioxide (CO$_2$), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and ammonia (NH$_3$) can lead to adverse health effects over prolonged exposure periods. Effective monitoring of these parameters is essential for preserving comfort, health, and safety within indoor spaces.

The proposed monitoring system addresses these critical needs by providing instantaneous feedback and intuitive data visualisation. Unlike conventional monitoring systems that depend on intermittent manual measurements, this IoT-enabled solution automates the data collection process and delivers actionable insights in real time. This automation ensures continuous surveillance and timely alerts, enabling proactive management of environmental conditions to mitigate potential health risks and enhance living conditions.
